INSIGHTS :
Targeted Market Expansion: Focus on Indonesia and the UAE for opening new restaurants due to high customer engagement (votes) and willingness to pay (higher average price range). These countries present lucrative opportunities for expansion.

Quality Enhancement in Key Markets: In India and Singapore, where restaurant ratings are lower despite high food expenditure, thereâ€™s a clear need to improve quality. Enhancing the dining experience here could capture more market share and improve customer loyalty.

Price Sensitivity Strategy: For markets like Sri Lanka and Canada, where the average price range is lower, offering cost-effective dining options without compromising on quality can attract price-sensitive customers.

Menu Localization: Tailor restaurant menus to match local tastes. For example, offer Indian cuisine in India and adapt international cuisines in regions where they are less common, ensuring the menu resonates with local preferences.

Optimize Online Services: Strengthen online delivery and table booking services to enhance convenience and reduce errors, which can positively impact customer satisfaction and ratings.

Leverage Customer Data: Utilize data from online orders to understand customer preferences and behavior better. This information can help in refining marketing strategies, customizing menus, and improving overall service quality.

Efficient Peak Management: Implement and optimize table booking systems to manage customer flow during peak hours, reducing wait times and improving the overall dining experience.

Niche Market Exploration: Consider opening niche restaurants in smaller markets like Canada and Sri Lanka. Tailored offerings that meet local demands could perform well in these regions.

Premium Offerings in High-Expenditure Markets: In countries like the UAE and Singapore, where per capita food expenditure is high, focusing on premium dining experiences can cater to affluent customers looking for high-quality service and food.

Sustained Quality Improvement in India: Given India's high restaurant expenditure but low ratings, ongoing efforts to improve food quality and customer service are crucial. This can involve regular staff training, stricter quality controls, and actively seeking customer feedback to ensure continuous improvement.
